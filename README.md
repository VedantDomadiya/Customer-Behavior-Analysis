# Customer-Behavior-Analysis

Customer Behavior Analysis
This is my Python project on customer behavior analysis, which enables businesses to improve customer experiences, make data-driven decisions, and maintain their competitiveness in a market that is constantly changing. Organizations can improve customer experiences, customize strategies, and make well-informed decisions with the aid of this analysis. 

The steps we took to complete the customer behavior analysis task are listed below:
1. Gather information about consumer interactions. Purchase history, website visits, social media activity, client testimonials, and more may be included.
2. To ensure the accuracy and quality of the data, locate and deal with outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies.
3. To summarize data, compute fundamental statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
4. Construct visualizations to examine trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
5. Group clients based on shared traits or behaviors by using strategies like clustering.
